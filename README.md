# Version-Control-Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates my experience with Git and GitLab through a version control exercise as part of my coursework. The project involved various Git operations such as branching, committing, pushing changes, resolving merge conflicts, tagging versions, and more.

## Tasks Performed:
1. **Created a GitLab Repository:** Set up a repository and created a new branch `Working` to isolate development changes.
2. **Cloned Repository Locally:** Cloned the remote repository to my local machine and worked with Git Bash for Windows.
3. **Modified HTML Files:** Made modifications to three HTML files, committing each change with a descriptive message.
4. **Handled Branching & Merging:** Created a `Test` branch, made updates, and merged it into the `Working` branch, resolving conflicts.
5. **Versioning:** Tagged the repository as `V1.0.0` after successfully completing the tasks.

## Key Skills Demonstrated:
- Branching and merging with Git.
- Managing merge conflicts.
- Tagging a release version.
- Using Git Bash and GitLab.


## Conclusion:
Through this project, I enhanced my understanding of version control systems, crucial for collaboration in modern software development.

## Funny enough..
I used git to clone a repo from my remote repo on Github, and pushed everything...using git...
